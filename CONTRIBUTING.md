## Getting Started 🚀

To get started fork the Repository on GitHub.

### Prerequisites
- Python
- Node.js

If you don't have these just install them from the official websites.

#### Cloning the repository
Clone the forked repository(make sure to insert your username):
```
git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/GoodMorningTech.git
```
Move into the new directory:
```
cd GoodMorningTech
```
#### Configuration
Create an `instance` folder:
```
mkdir instance
```
Move the configuration template into `instance` and rename it to `config.py`:
Windows:
```
copy config.template.py config.py
move config.py instance
```
Linux:
``` 
cp config.template.py config.py
mkdir instance
mv config.py instance/config.py
```
Edit the configuration file and set the fields to your liking.

For the database to work create a mongoDB database and set the `MONGO_URI` to your database.

To use the email functionality set the `MAIL_USERNAME`,`MAIL_PASSWORD` and `MAIL_SERVER`
to your email credentials, for gmail you might need to configure extra stuff,
look up recent guides on how to use SMTP with gmail.

Alternatively you can configure everything from environment variables, make sure to set all the variables in `config.template.py`.
